# The-maze-
Project for the Advanced Data Struct & Algo class


---Objective--- 
The maze is a program that will be able to build random mazes and solve them. They may be other features, like a little game for the user, to make this project kind of playful. 

---Building---
I'm planning to make a graph for the construction of the maze. I'll probably use an adjacency matrice, to have a rectangular maze (obviously) and have defined paths. I've read something about the Dijkstra's algorithm, to find the shortest path to solve the maze. I don't have a lot of content for the moment but I'll start the project very soon. I'm planning to do a console application. 

EDIT
I chose to create the maze using a graph, instead of a matrix (which would be way more simple but I wanted to use what we say in class). I'm working on the random generation of the maze using a spanning tree, more precisely an algorithm with a depth first search. I'll do the first commit when it works, along with the print method. After that, I'll focus on the solving of the maze, using (I guess) the Dijkstra's algorithm. 
 

This project is not related to another class (I created it for this class), and I do it alone.
