# The-maze-
Project for the Advanced Data Struct & Algo class

The maze is a program that is able to build random mazes with a selected size, and solve them. 

I created the maze using a graph, each node representing a cell and edges representing the paths between the cells.
I generate a random maze using a deep first search algorithm, and solve it with a breadth first search algorithm.
I converted the graph into a matrix for the printing. 

This project is not related to another class (I created it for this class), and I do it alone.
